# 2DRPG
2D tile map game built using Unity Game Engine

This is the very first oriject I worked on and is not very efficient
It is however pretty full featured, and has a lot that I am proud of.
That being said, I will eventually rewrite the game in a more 
efficient way.

Game includes
- Start screen where you can choose character and game mode
- Single player and multiplayer lobbies
- Save system, writes users info onto a json file and reads from the file on load
- Inventory system for storing items
- Item library, saves info about swords, potions, armor, etc...
- Non Player Characters that you can interact with (they give quests/mission and sell items)
- Health system used for combat
- Enemy creatures that follow AI generated path to reach player and attack them
- Player can "wield" weapons and potions
- 2D colliders that handle collision between player and environment
- 2D annimation of players and others
- Fishing mini game included
- Mediocre looking UI
